# CESMapper
QGIS plugin to provide Coastal and Estuarine System Mapping (CESM) functionality within a geospatial framework.


The CESMapper plugin for QGIS has been developed as part of the Integrating COAstal Sediment sySTems (iCOASST) project, funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC project NE/J005541/1). 
Further information on Coastal and Estuarine System Mapping (CESM) and iCOASST can be found at:

The CESM approach is described more fully in:
